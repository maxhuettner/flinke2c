# Experiments Notebook

`exps.ipynb` is the single entry point for reviewers: it consolidates the experiment data and regenerates every plot.

Steps:
- Activate the local virtualenv: `source .venv/bin/activate` (create with `python -m venv .venv` if needed).
- Launch Jupyter from this directory (`jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`) and open `exps.ipynb`.
- Run the notebook to inspect the aggregated metrics and refresh the figures or exports.
